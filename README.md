# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game allows players to control a snake using arrow keys, with the objective of eating food to score points while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body.

## Features
- Three game modes: easy, medium, and hard.
- Responsive snake movement with different speeds based on the selected mode.
- Score tracking and display on the screen.
- Game over and restart functionality.
- Colorful display with randomly generated pastel colors for the snake and a blue circle as food.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   
2. **Installation**: No additional libraries are required beyond Python's standard library.

3. **Usage**: Run `main.py` to start the game. Select a mode (`easy`, `medium`, or `hard`) using the prompt and control the snake with arrow keys. Press `space` to restart the game after game over.

## Future Enhancements
- Add sound effects for actions such as eating food and game over.
- Implement levels with increasing difficulty.
- Allow customization of snake colors and game settings.
- Show menu for movement guidance
- show mode prompt as buttons instead of input

## Acknowledgments
- This project was inspired by classic Snake games and uses Turtle graphics for Python.
